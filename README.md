<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I
created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I
think this is it.

Here's why:

* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near
future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all
the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for
the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following requirements installed on your system:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (recommended version: 3.11.4)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (recommended version: 20.5.0)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   https://github.com/Grupo-Criptografia/LockBox.git
   ```
2. After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory or open with an IDE.

3. Open a terminal in the project's root directory to Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (venv), run the
   following commands:
    ```sh
   # On Unix or MacOS systems
   python3 -m venv venv-env
   
   # On Windows systems
   python -m venv venv
   or
   py -m venv venv
   
   # Activate the virtual environment
   
   # On Unix or MacOS systems
   source venv-env/bin/activate
   
   # On Windows systems
   source venv/Scripts/activate
   ```

4. Inside the virtual environment, use pip to install Python requirements from the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. navigate to the folder `lock_box_client`:
    ```sh
   cd lock_box_client
   ```

6. Run the following commands to install Node.js dependencies from the package.json file:
    ```sh
   npm install
   ```
7. To verify that every tool is installed, run this command:
   ```sh
   python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools
   ```
8. To check that the installation was successful run the following commands:
   *  Open a terminal in the **project's root directory** and run:
   ```sh
   # On Unix or MacOS systems
   python3 manage.py runserver
   
   # On Windows systems
   python manage.py runserver
   or
   py manage.py runserver
   ```
    *  Open a other terminal in the project's root directory and run:
   ```sh
   cd lock_box_client

   npm run dev
   ```
